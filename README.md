# Usupervised dimension reduction for hyperspectral images

This is an implementation of the weighted feature extraction (WFE) and fuzzy feature extraction (FFE) feature extraction techniques that we proposed in our paper below. If you use it, kindly cite it.

- Run test.m to see how used the functions.

- Due to the large size of the hyperspectral image, I was unable to upload it. However, you can download it (Indian Pines) here: [https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes#Pavia_Centre_scene].

This project utilizes the [Open Source MATLAB Hyperspectral Toolbox] ([(https://github.com/isaacgerg/matlabHyperspectralToolbox)]) developed by [Isaac Gerg] ([https://github.com/isaacgerg]). This toolbox played a crucial role in implementing my codes within this project.


The source code will be uploaded soon.
